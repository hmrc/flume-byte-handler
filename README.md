[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/hmrc/flume-byte-handler.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/hmrc/flume-byte-handler) [ ![Download](https://api.bintray.com/packages/hmrc/releases/flume-byte-handler/images/download.svg) ](https://bintray.com/hmrc/releases/flume-byte-handler/_latestVersion)

This is a high performance handler for use with the Flume HttpSource. It does no
processing of the HTTP request beyond copying the byte payload into a single
Flume event. It is also coded to support large message payloads by minimising
the amount of memory allocated for each event, and pre-allocating the correct
event memory size based on the HTTP Content-Length header value (where this is
available).

To use this handler, you must specify its class in the HttpSource in your Flume
configuration file. An example of this is :

```properties
audit.sources = httpSource
audit.channels = memoryChannel
audit.sinks = nullSink

# Source for accepting HTTP calls
audit.sources.httpSource.type = http
audit.sources.httpSource.channels = memoryChannel
audit.sources.httpSource.port = 9001
audit.sources.httpSource.handler = uk.gov.hmrc.flume.handler.SimpleByteHandler

# Provides an in-memory channel
audit.channels.memoryChannel.type = memory

# Null Sink
audit.sinks.nullSink.type = null
audit.sinks.nullSink.channel = memoryChannel
```
